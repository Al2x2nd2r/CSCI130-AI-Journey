### What I Learned
This week I learned how to create, clone, and commit changes to repositories using Git and GitHub. I also gained a basic understanding of Python syntax and how to write, run, and troubleshoot a simple program that interacts with the user. Overall, I gained a rudimentary sense of version control and Python skills that will help me create and manage projects more effectively in the future.

### Challenges
Originally, I didn’t understand the format of Python code. I’ve previously worked with HTML, CSS, and GSC (Call of Duty’s scripting language derived from C++), which are much more flexible with indentation. However, in this simple Python script, I had about three indentation errors that stopped my code from running entirely. Fixing those issues helped me understand how critical proper indentation and structure are in Python.
